		\begin{enumerate}[I.]
			\item expression "i \& (i - 1) + 1" is frequently used to count the bit '1' appearing in a certain integer.\\Proof: suppose that variable i is odd, then i - 1 must be a even whose binary representation is same as i' s except the last one bit, in this situation, "+ 1" represents the last one bit in i. When variable i is even, i \& i - 1 will just get rid of the last one bit '1' in i's bianry representation, in this situationm "+ 1" represention the missing '1'.
